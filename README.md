# DeXt0r---A-hash-calculator
This is a simple python program which was written to calculate hashes of  the file and compare them to check the integrity of the files downloaded from the opensource projects website. Note I wasnt able to create an installer as the installer was throwing error, but the program is running flawless from the pycharm ide.
